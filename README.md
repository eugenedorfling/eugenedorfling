Hello! I’m a passionate software developer with over five years of experience in Python, specializing in backend development, cloud systems, and IoT projects. My journey began with personal IoT experiments on Raspberry Pi, which quickly evolved into more complex projects, including building and managing a simulator racing center’s backend system.

I thrive in creating robust, scalable solutions, and I’m particularly skilled in developing with frameworks like Django, FastAPI, and Flask. I’ve built everything from TCP servers for managing simulator systems to full-fledged cloud systems hosted on AWS, integrating various modules like race control, telemetry, customer management, and more.

I’m also experienced in frontend development with React, database management using PostgreSQL, and implementing CI/CD pipelines for seamless deployment. Whether it’s designing RESTful APIs, managing secure endpoints, or ensuring system reliability through backups and logging, I approach each challenge with a dedication to quality and innovation.

I’m always eager to learn, explore new technologies, and contribute to exciting projects.
